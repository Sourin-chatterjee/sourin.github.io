I am pursuing a **Ph.D. in Physics** at the **Indian Institute of Technology Madras**.

My research focuses on **frustrated quantum magnetism** and computational approaches to emergent quantum phases, including:
- Projective Symmetry Group (PSG) classification
- Mean-field Ansätze
- Static and dynamical structure factors for experimental comparison

My broader interests include renormalization-group methods and numerical approaches to strongly correlated systems.
